# Embedded Systems + AI
This is list of projects related to Embedded system with Include GUI and/or AI 

 ## Tic Tac Toe Game using Arduino and TFT LCD 
 This game will help to learn simple game logic and simple AI system. Also Graphics Programming in Embedded Systems
     
 ## Maze Solver
 There are number of possible projects. The C# project for solving Maze, finding shortest path and then sending this to robot using RF or Wifi. This could also be made with Android interfacing via Bluetooth. Or this could be also build totally within Microcontroller. A Raspberry PI could be used. 
 
 ## Radar using Arduino Ultrasonic and Android Processing
Processing sketch to be uploaded on Android and Arduino connected with bluetooth. Ultrasonic Module will be interfaced with arduino and placed on Servo motor. Will continue rotating and find object that object will be send to Android via Bluetooth and on Android a Radar like GUI will display object in RED waves

 ## THD calculation in Current Wave using MATLAB
 A signal will be sampled via arduino and transmitted to MATLAB/Simulink to analyze and calculate THD which is short form of Total Harmonic distortion. This will be done via FFT Analysis. A visual representation will also be displayed on Simulink or MATLAB
 
 ## Indoor position System Robot 
   This will be done using Arduino and some position finding algorithm will be implemented. One possible thing for this is via bluetooth ibeacon system. HM-10 bluetooth module could be used as Ibeacon which could send it's distance. There are also other posible algorithms
   
 ## Digital Stethoscope
   To litsen heartbeat we use Stethoscope. In this project we will digitize sound data via mic. After preamplification we will apply butterworth fiter to filter heart sound only. Then we will project that sound to some visual graphical representation and to Speaker. We can also do some possible Processings and/or analysis on sound
   
  ## Sound Recognition
  Sound recognition will be used to identify some sound patterns. This could be done with or without help of MATLAB interfacing. We could also do this in Raspberry PI or on STM32 platform. 
  
  ## Speech Recognition
   Speech recognition task is complicated task and could be modified to vast variety of projects. This could be done on microcontroller for identfying some simple words or with the help of Google Assistance or some online speech recognition API like Alexa we could identify complete sentences. Raspberry Pi could be used if we are using online API.
